#Important

If you're looking for examples on how to initialize Vizabi, or use it, check the following links:

- DOCS: http://static.gapminderdev.org/vizabi/docs/
- Simple example on initialization (bl.ocks.org): http://bl.ocks.org/angieskazka/ed82b664173a9023fa8a
- Simple data example (codepen): http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pJpJgb

This folder will not be much helpful for examples. It contains only source code to *generate* preview pages used primarily by developers when testing their tools and demoing features. The pages are statically generated using [Assemble](http://assemble.io/).
