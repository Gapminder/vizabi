# Gapminder Vizabi

You can contribute to the development of tools or the framework.

Here are some of the things we would love to improve:

- Development of awesome visualization tools
- Improvement of QA and testing routines
- More readers that support various data formats
- More buttons and UI controls
- Offline support

// TODO: fill it with *testing* section, *cloning repo*, etc...
