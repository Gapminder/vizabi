# Roadmap

TODO: make normal structure with milestones
For now it will be just a list of notes

- Replace `travis.yml` script with default `npm test` command;
- Deploy to staging should be done in `prepublish` hook or by manual command like `npm deploy`;
- Replace Grunt with Gulp;
- Move AWS keys to config (Gruntfile it's not a place for AWS keys parsing);
- Write some documentation in README (Getting Started, Examples, etc...);
